# Decentraland-NFT-Trading-Volume-with-Moralis-SDK
This is a project that I made in 2019-2020 which was the time of NFT hype.  I deducted that there are two non subjective variable that could be analyzed when a person wants to buy NFT. These are social media hype and trading volume. This is the analysis of the latter

Requirements : moralis, pandas, pandas-json normalize, datetime, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, time

#Moralis

The Moralis SDK is a software development kit provided by Moralis, a platform designed to simplify Web3 development. It offers tools and libraries that allow developers to easily create decentralized applications (dApps) on various blockchains. Here I use Moralis to interact with Decentraland NFT smart contract

#Pandas

widely-used open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly. Pandas is especially useful for handling large datasets and performing complex data operations with just a few lines of code.

#Json normalize

A function in the Python library pandas that is used to flatten semi-structured JSON data into a flat table or DataFrame. JSON data often contains nested structures, such as dictionaries within dictionaries or lists of dictionaries, which can be difficult to work with directly in tabular formats like CSV or DataFrames.

The json_normalize function takes JSON objects and expands the nested structures into columns of a DataFrame, making it easier to analyze and manipulate the data.

Key Features:

-Flattening Nested Data: It converts nested JSON structures into a flat table, with each nested key becoming a column.

-Handling Lists and Dicts: It can handle lists of dictionaries within the JSON data, expanding them into rows.

-Customizable Path Expansion: You can specify paths to certain nested elements to be expanded or to ignore.

#datetime

Module in Python's standard library that provides classes for manipulating dates and times. It allows you to work with dates, times, and both together as datetime objects.

#Numpy

Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

#Matplotlib.pyplot

A submodule of the Matplotlib library, designed for creating 2D plots and graphs. 

#Time

Module provides various time-related functions that allow you to work with time in seconds
